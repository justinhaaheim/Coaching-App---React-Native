# Empower App :high_brightness:
An app that provides tools, resources and weekly notes to support you to realize your most important goals and dreams.

## Background

I started learning ReactJS / React Native, and love it. This is a learning / development project, drawing inspiration from Sam Lu's fabulous [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html), and Wei Fang's [30 Days of React Native](https://github.com/fangwei716/30-days-of-react-native). Each day, I will be taking the lessons, concepts, frameworks and components I encounter and turning them into features and functionalities of a working app: Empower. 

The app's subject matter draws upon my [writing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/justin-haaheim) and work as a [Leadership Coach](http://justinh.org/coaching). Hence: *Empower*. 

The React community has blown me away from day 1 with its generosity. There are tutorials, open source tools and components, and people eager to help at just about every turn. Lots and lots of tools and components. On that note, one of my favorite JS-related tweets:

> **Alex Kotliarskyi**  
> @alex_frantic - [1:53 PM - 27 Mar 2017](https://twitter.com/alex_frantic/status/846419956493275136)  
> Headlines "Using JS in 2017", "Using React Native in March 2017". Waiting for "Best JS tools to use this afternoon, March 27, 2017"

All that help has been invaluable, and I'm glad to pay it forward. As I continue on, I will share the resources I've found most helpful here.

And to document my learning and make it accessible to others, I'll share screenshots and descriptions of the new things I'm developing as I develop them.

I'm always glad to hear from folks. Get in touch on twitter: [@justinhaaheim](https://twitter.com/justinhaaheim) Or write me a note: io at justin h dot org.

## Project Plan

#### Starting:
- [x] Install node, watchman, react-native, yarn. Figure what the heck those things actually do.
- [x] Evaluate viability/preferability of Expo development platform. 
- [x] Hello world. Experiment with text layout
- [x] Extend TouchableOpacity, drawing from F8 app button implementation, to create buttons that toggle (select and deselect)
- [x] Determine best place for the relatively simple application logic, and how to make use of *state*.
- [x] Hook up: buttons add and remove text to/from text field below.
- [x] Compile and test on physical device.
- [x] Add an app icon and a launch screen, because vanity.

#### Next up:
- [ ] Create a side "hamburger" menu
- [ ] Create an About page, and list any necessary copyrights/attributions
- [ ] Add an explanation of the arena, and the purpose of the app
- [ ] Create setting to switch between two different versions of Arena
- [ ] Implement file storage to save state between closings-openings of the app
- [ ] Create a Reset button for the list of qualities

#### Publishing:
- [ ] Initiate process to get developer license.
- [ ] Test the app on multiple different layouts. Do necessary scaling to accomodate larger/smaller devices.

#### Second Screen/Route: 
- [ ] Project: Create a second app screen/route that hosts the most recent Note from Justin, first just images, and then make it possible to display the textual note.
- [ ] Create a setting for the user to enter their first name, to customize the notes

#### Visual/animation:
- [ ] Use Shoutem or a comparable project to make the app more beautiful
- [ ] Create beautiful transitions and effects using the react animate library. Special button effect when tapping on a quality? Or a shake/bounce when the qualities are cleared?

#### Future:
- [ ] Implement a swedish version of the app using localization files
- [ ] Test and publish an Android version of the app, re-using as much of the codebase as possible.
- [ ] Implement a screen to allow people to book a session.
- [ ] Consider developing a way that coaches can distribute this app to their clients with a special code/account that directs them to their specific coach's booking page.
