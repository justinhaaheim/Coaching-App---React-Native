# Empower App
An app that provides tools, resources and weekly notes to support you to realize your most important goals and dreams.

I started learning ReactJS / React Native, and love it. This is a learning / development project, drawing inspiration from Sam Lu's fabulous [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html), and Wei Fang's [30 Days of React Native](https://github.com/fangwei716/30-days-of-react-native). Each day, I will be taking the lessons, concepts, frameworks and components I encounter and turning them into features and functionalities of a working app: Empower. 

The app's subject matter draws upon my [writing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/justin-haaheim) and work as a [Leadership Coach](http://justinh.org/coaching). Hence: *Empower*. 

The React community has blown me away from day 1 with its generosity. There are tutorials, open source tools and components, and people eager to help at just about every turn. Lots and lots of tools and components. On that note, one of my favorite JS-related tweets:

> @alex_frantic - [1:53 PM - 27 Mar 2017](https://twitter.com/alex_frantic/status/846419956493275136)  
> Headlines "Using JS in 2017", "Using React Native in March 2017". Waiting for "Best JS tools to use this afternoon, March 27, 2017"

All that help has been invaluable, and I'm glad to pay it forward. As I continue on, I will share the resources I've found most helpful here.

And to document my learning and make it accessible to others, I'll share screenshots and descriptions of the new things I'm developing as I develop them.

I'm always glad to hear from folks. Get in touch on twitter: [@justinhaaheim](https://twitter.com/justinhaaheim) Or write me a note: io at justin h dot org.
